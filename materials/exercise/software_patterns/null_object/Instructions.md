# Instructions 

You are now responsible for the extension of a small script that processes data from our student api. 
The script as it is now has been left by one of your colleagues who created the initial business logic according to the requirement. 

While doing our first UAT we found out that the logic as it is now is not completely working as expected.
It turned out that the API is return an empty body if the data of a student id is already delete. 
The original dev as such plugged in some checks - but our TechLead complaint about the absence of programming patterns. 

Can you improve the script and its conditionals?
