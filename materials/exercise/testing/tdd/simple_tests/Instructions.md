# Instructions 


Here you can find the code of a small calculator app that sums two numbers.
At the moment we just have the technical implementation and no system interface. 
Though we want to test this first iteration of development. 

## Task

In the test_app.py you can see the beginning of tests we have created to test the logic of our code. 
Can you continue to complete the test s.t. we reach 100% of code coverage ?
